# Openemu-
Everytime i try to open a game on openemu the game turns black. I can hear sounds from the game but can't see anything. Though when i open it in nintendo i can see the bottom screen but can't see the upper screen. This didn't happen at patch 1.0.3 but as sson as i downloaded patch 1.0.4 i coulnd't play. Hopefully you guys can help
